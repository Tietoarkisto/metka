Documents are analyzed using WhiteSpaceAnalyzer as the default analyzer, using FinnishVoikkoAnalyzer for field 'int1' and 'float1' and using KeywordAnalyzer of fields 'int2' and 'float2'

-- Data --
All documents contain the following fields:
int1 which is a finnish voikko analyzed text field
int2 which is a keyword analyzed text field
int3 which is a IntField and searcher is told to regard it as an IntField
int4 which is a IntField with seracher not told to regard it as an IntField
float1 which is a finnish voikko analyzed text field
float2 which is a keyword analyzed text field
float3 which is a FloatField and searcher is told to regard it as an FloatField
float4 which is a FloatField with seracher not told to regard it as an FloatField

New document: ID (1) | Integer (1) | Float (1.5)
New document: ID (2) | Integer (2) | Float (2.5)
New document: ID (3) | Integer (3) | Float (3.5)
New document: ID (4) | Integer (4) | Float (4.5)
New document: ID (5) | Integer (5) | Float (5.5)

-- Queries --
All queries are performed for all fields except document_id
All queries are performed with + in their field clause meaning that the query is a MUST query (document must contain result)
All query results contain the number of results and the ID's of the documents that contain a hit.
Results are in following order: 
Result 1: int1
Result 2: int2
Result 3: int3
Result 4: int4
Result 5: float1
Result 6: float2
Result 7: float3
Result 8: float4
