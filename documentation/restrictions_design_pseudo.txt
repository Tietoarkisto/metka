Data (pseudo)
operations : [0..* Restriction]

Restriction (pseudo)
operation : [SAVE|APPROVE|REMOVE]
conditions : [0..* Condition] {ordered}

Condition (pseudo)
target : [Target]
type : [VALUE|NOT_EMPTY|IS_EMPTY|EQUALS|UNIQUE|INCREASING|DECREASING]
conditions : [0..* Condition] {ordered}

Target (pseudo)
type: [FIELD|QUERY|VALUE]
target: String

- At some point we need some sort of expression system to allow dynamically generating conditions from parametrised conditions
- Container conditions should be formed as trees to facilitate ease of use, field paths are not supported in conditions.
- Each operation should have their own conditions keeping in mind if APPROVE operation is running then SAVE has to have successfully completed already

Conditions we need
* Value (Target VALUE)
	- Plain string value that is used as subcondition of some specific type of conditions
	- Does nothing on its own (is always true except when actually requested by some other condition)
* Non empty (Target FIELD|QUERY)
	- Restriction applies if given field has non empty value
	- Top level fields can only target other top level fields
	- Container fields can target top level fields and fields in their own container row
	- For non container fields this means there has to be non empty value
	- For container fields this means there has to be rows (rows can still be basically empty in case of CONTAINER and need to be checked separately)
	- For query this means that query needs to return results
* Is empty (Target FIELD|QUERY)
	- Restriction applies if targeted content has no value
	- Top level fields can only target other top level fields
	- Container fields can target top level fields and fields in their own container row
	- For non container fields this means there has to be empty value
	- For container fields this means there has to be no rows
	- For query this means that query needs to return 0 results
* Equals (Target FIELD)
	- Restriction applies if given field has value that equals subconditions
	- Top level fields can only target other top level fields
	- Container fields can target top level fields and fields in their own container row
	- Needs to have one or more VALUE type sub conditions that contain the values that we are comparing to
	- Needs to target non container field (containers can't equal anything)
* Uniqueness (Target FIELD)
	- Must target non container field (plain containers can't be unique in any meaningful sense and revisionable containers should  always contain only one reference with the same value by default).
	- Top level field must be unique between revisionables (field can have the same value from revision to revision but other revisionables can't have the same value in any revision).
	- Container fields must be unique within their container so that no other row in the container has the same value in the field with the same key
	- Field can remain the same or change throughout the revisions, the value is only compared to other revisionables
* Increasing (Target FIELD)
	- Uses natural sorting to find this out
	- For top level fields value must increase between revisions, never decrease
	- For container fields value must increase between non removed rows even through reordering rows
* Decreasing (Target FIELD)
	- Uses natural sorting to find this out
	- For top level fields value must decrease between revisions, never increase
	- For container fields value must increase between non removed rows even through reordering rows
