This is DDI-Codebook version 2.5,1 published on 2013-12-01 as approved for publication
by the DDI Alliance Expert Committee, with minor revisions.

THIS IS A SUB-MINOR REVISION of 2.5 and does not change the namespace of DDI-C v2.5.

The current publication includes the schemas, field-level documentation publication in 
HTML, and change documentation.

The continued development of DDI-Codebook reflects the work of the
committees and individuals who developed DDI versions 1.0 - 2.1 as well as the collective
ideas, needs, and work of the Expert Committee of the DDI Alliance.
